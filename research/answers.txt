Question: 1. Can you explain the importance of strengthening domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, as outlined in Target 17.1?
Answer: Strengthening domestic resource mobilization, including through international support to developing countries, as outlined in Target 17.1 is crucial for sustainable development. By enhancing a country's capacity for tax and revenue collection, it allows governments to fund essential services such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, and social welfare programs. This, in turn, helps reduce dependency on foreign aid and promotes self-sufficiency and economic stability. Additionally, mobilizing resources domestically can lead to more efficient and transparent governance, which is essential for sustainable development and poverty eradication. International support can further assist developing countries in building their capacity for revenue collection and creating a more stable financial environment.

Question: 4. How can developing countries be assisted in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, and debt restructuring, as appropriate, as mentioned in Target 17.4?
Answer: Developing countries can be assisted in attaining long-term debt sustainability through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, and debt restructuring by implementing the following measures:

1. Providing debt relief: This involves reducing or canceling the debt burden of developing countries to make their debt more manageable.

2. Offering debt restructuring: This involves renegotiating the terms of the debt, such as extending the repayment period or reducing interest rates, to make it more sustainable for the country.

3. Promoting responsible debt financing: Encouraging responsible borrowing practices to prevent countries from accumulating unsustainable levels of debt.

4. Coordinating policies: Working together with international financial institutions, governments, and other stakeholders to ensure a comprehensive approach to debt sustainability.

By implementing these measures and fostering cooperation among various stakeholders, developing countries can work towards achieving long-term debt sustainability as outlined in Target 17.4.

Question: 10. By 2030, how can progress on sustainable development be measured beyond gross domestic product, and how can statistical capacity-building in developing countries be supported, as outlined in Target 17.19?
Answer: Progress on sustainable development beyond gross domestic product can be measured by developing measurements that complement GDP and support statistical capacity-building in developing countries. This can be achieved by building on existing initiatives to develop measurements of progress on sustainable development that consider various factors like income, gender, age, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability, geographic location, and other relevant characteristics in national contexts. Statistical capacity-building in developing countries can be supported by enhancing capacity-building support to these countries, including least developed countries and small island developing States, to significantly increase the availability of high-quality, timely, and reliable data disaggregated by various factors. This support aims to strengthen the statistical infrastructure and capabilities of developing countries to effectively monitor progress towards sustainable development goals.
